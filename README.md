# How to run

In order to build the website first you need to install gulp cli and this can be done as long as you have installed `node`. 

```
npm install gulp -g
```

Once this is installed you can now nagivate inside of the website folder and run the following command `npm install`. Once this is complete simply type `gulp` in order to bring up the website. The website will be hosted on port 3001.
